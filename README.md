# Simple-Localhost-Server-with-Website
A simple localhost server with a simple webpage to learn basics of Spring Framework (still learning! will be improved! :)

Currently, website only runs on localhost:5000/ (still not visible to the public yet, but will be soon!)

Goals:
1. To make the server public
2. To learn HTML and build an awesome website! :)
